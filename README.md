 This script convert a text to the corresponding morse code in the form of text or song, the last one is a great way to learn morse!
 You will need to install the pyglet module for python2 to run the script and of course run it with python 2 (using "python2.7 ./morse.py").
  if you just run the script without argument it will play the morse code as a song, if you add the argument "text" it will give you the corresponding text.
